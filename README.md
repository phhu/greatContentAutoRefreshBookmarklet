# reloadAndBeepOnChangeBookmarklet
A bookmarklet used to create a beep when new jobs appear on supertresc.pl / greatcontent 

It reloads the page at specified intervals and looks for an increase in the number of table rows in the content div. IF there is an increase, a beep sound is emitted three times. 

This is useful because it saves having to manually refresh and monitor the page for new jobs: you will hear a beep when new jobs appear, and can take them promptly.
