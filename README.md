# reloadAndBeepOnChangeBookmarklet
A bookmarklet used to create a beep when new jobs appear on supertresc.pl

It reloads the page at specified intervals and looks for an increase in the number of table rows in the content div. IF there is an increase, a beep sound is emitted three times.

This is useful because it saves having to manually refresh and monitor the page for new jobs.
